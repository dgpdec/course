=================================================================================

DGP-DEC is a framework for writing digital geometry processing (DGP) applications. 
It provides a simple and practical interface for typical geometry operations based 
on Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC).

// BUILDING //
//////////////

0) cd <application_folder>
1) Comment/uncomment the header flags for your OS
2) make
3) ./<application_name> <input>

////////////////////
// VIEWER CONTROL //
////////////////////

Mouse: 
* left_click: rotate
* right_click: show menu
* shift + left_click: pick/unpick vertex

Shortcuts:
* w: save mesh
* f: wireframe on/off
* space: run application
* Apple/Ctrl+r: reload mesh
* -/=: decrease/increase time step

//////////////////
// DEPENDENCIES //
//////////////////

* GLUT
* GLSL
* Tim Davis' SuiteSparseQR sparse QR factorization library:
 
      http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SPQR/

  which in turn depends on SuiteSparse and METIS:

      http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/SuiteSparse/
      http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/views/metis

  as well as some (hopefully optimized!) BLAS/LAPACK implementation.
  On UNIX-like systems you will probably end up needing the libraries

  bamd.a
  libcamd.a
  libcolamd.a
  libccolamd.a
  libcholmod.a
  libspqr.a

  from SuiteSparse and

  libmetis.a

  from METIS.  If you want to avoid compiling all of SuiteSparse, you can simply
  type "make" in each of the appropriate Lib directories (e.g., AMD/Lib) after
  setting up UFConfig and copying the resulting library (.a) files to
  /usr/local/bin or some other appropriate place.  Further instructions on
  building SuiteSparse and its dependencies can be found on the SuiteSparse home
  page.

  On Mac OS X, the easiest way to link to an efficient BLAS
  implementation is by adding the framework

  -framework Accelerate

  On other platforms, Kazushige Goto's GotoBLAS library is a popular choice:

1) Add code for your application in "include/Application.h".
2) Call Application inside Viewer::mProcess() in "src/Viewer.cpp".
3) Customize any other class according to your application.
